Cucumber Selenium and RestAssured Framework
This is a test automation framework built using Cucumber, Selenium, and RestAssured. The framework enables you to write and execute automated tests for both web and API applications.

Features
BDD Approach: The framework uses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology, allowing you to write tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax.
Web Testing: Selenium WebDriver is integrated with Cucumber to perform web UI testing on various browsers.
API Testing: RestAssured library is integrated with Cucumber to perform API testing and validation of RESTful services.
Modular Structure: The framework follows a modular structure, making it easy to organize and maintain test scenarios, step definitions, and page objects.
Data-driven Testing: The framework supports data-driven testing by allowing you to separate test data from test scripts using external data sources such as Excel or CSV files.
Reporting: Cucumber's built-in reporting feature generates detailed HTML reports, providing insights into test execution results.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed before running the framework:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
Maven build tool
Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Getting Started


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git


Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Update the dependencies by running the following Maven command:

mvn clean install



Sure! Here's a template for a README file that you can use for your Cucumber, Selenium, and RestAssured framework:
